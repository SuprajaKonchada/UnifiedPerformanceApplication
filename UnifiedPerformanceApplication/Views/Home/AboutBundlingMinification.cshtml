    <p>Minification and bundling are essential concepts in ASP.NET MVC for optimizing the performance of web applications.</p>

    <h2>Bundling</h2>
    <p>Bundling allows you to combine multiple JavaScript and CSS files into a single file. This reduces the number of HTTP requests made by the browser, which can significantly improve the load time of your web application.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <p>In <code>bundleconfig.json</code>, you might see something like this:</p>
        <pre>
            {
                "outputFileName": "wwwroot/css/site.min.css",
                "inputFiles": [
                    "wwwroot/css/site.css",
                    "wwwroot/css/about.css"
                ]
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Minification</h2>
    <p>Minification removes unnecessary characters from your CSS and JavaScript files without changing their functionality. This can drastically reduce the size of these files, which again improves load times.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <p>A minified version of a JavaScript file might look like this:</p>
        <pre>
            function showBundlingMessage(){alert("Minified JS example!")}
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>Together, bundling and minification help to optimize the delivery of your web assets, ensuring a faster, more efficient user experience.</p>
